"""Given an inRange(x,y) function, write a method that determines whether a given pair (x, y) falls in the range (x < 1/3 < y).
Essentially, youâ€™ll be implementing the body of a function that takes in two numbers x and y and returns True if x < 1/3 < y;
otherwise, it returns False."""

"""Relational operators such as < return either True or False and the solution,
therefore, becomes extremely straightforward.
We can simply return whatever the x < 1/3 < y statement yields"""
